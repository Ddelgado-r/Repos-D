        <p text align="justify">Tamales are a most to celebrate the holidays in Colombia. There are many different types of tamales in the country, this variation is popular in the Andean region of Colombia and my favorite tamal recipe because itâ€™s the way my mom make them.  </p>
        <p>Tamal is a traditional dish in Many Latin American countries. Every cook, region and family has its own variation. They use different fillings, cooking methods, ways to wrap the tamales, but the principal is the same.</p>

        <h2>TIPS TO PREPARE THE TAMAL</h2>
        <p>I suggest making the marinade a couple of days before to make the process easier, then the next day marinade the meat and place it in fridge overnight for extra flavor. Then the next day assemble the tamales and you can cook them the same day or keep them wrapped in the fridge and cook them the day after.</p>
