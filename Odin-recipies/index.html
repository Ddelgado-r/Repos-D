     <p>Colombia or politically known as the <em>Democratic Republic of Colombia</em> is a country located at south of the American continent and it has boundaries with countries like Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil and also is surrounded by the Pacific and Caribbean ocean. Colombia is full of a cultural biodiversity as well as an incredible wildlife and vegetation.</p>
     <p>As I said before Colombia has different cultures where each one has its traditions and dialects. Being said that, We are going to see some of the most tradional dishes at Colombia and how to prepare them step by step.</p><br>

     <h3>Colombian Recipies</h3>
     <p>To select three dishes from Colombia is a hard work and that's cause we have an inmensity of dishes to choose from, but in this case I have brought to you the dishes that in my opinion are the most iconic and delicious:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bandeja Paisa:</strong> This platter is probably the most popular Colombian dish, originally from the Andean region of the country where the people are called “Paisas” and the area where I was born and raised.</li>
